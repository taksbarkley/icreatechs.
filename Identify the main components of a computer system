1. Identify the main components of a computer system
A computer system is made up of three main components that work together to perform tasks and process data:
1. Hardware
These are the physical parts of a computer — the components you can touch and see.
Examples include:
Input devices – keyboard, mouse, scanner
Output devices – monitor, printer, speakers
Storage devices – hard drive (HDD/SSD), USB flash drive
Central Processing Unit (CPU) – the "brain" that processes instructions
Memory (RAM) – temporary storage for data being used
Motherboard – connects all components together

2. Software

This is the set of instructions or programs that tell the hardware what to do.
Types of software:
System software – manages hardware (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux)
Application software – performs specific tasks (e.g., MS Word, web browsers, games)

3. Peopleware (or Users)

These are the people who use, program, or manage the computer system.
Examples include:
End users
Programmers
System administrators
IT support staff
