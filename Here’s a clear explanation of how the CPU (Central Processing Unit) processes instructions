The CPU is the brain of the computer — it carries out all the processing by following a series of steps known as the fetch–decode–execute cycle.
The Fetch–Decode–Execute Cycle

1. Fetch
The CPU fetches (retrieves) an instruction from the main memory (RAM).
The Program Counter (PC) keeps track of the memory address of the next instruction.
The fetched instruction is stored in the Instruction Register (IR).

2. Decode
The Control Unit (CU) reads and decodes the fetched instruction to understand what needs to be done.
It identifies whether the instruction involves data movement, arithmetic, logic, or control.

3. Execute
The Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) or other CPU components carry out the instruction.
This might involve:
Performing calculations (add, subtract, compare)
Moving data between registers or memory
Making decisions or changing the flow of the program

4. Repeat
The Program Counter updates to point to the next instruction, and the cycle repeats — billions of times per second.
